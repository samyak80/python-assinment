# 
# Topic 1: Variables and Variable Naming
# 

#   Question 1  
# Issue: No issue; valid variable declaration and printing.
name = "Raju"
print("Name:", name)

#   Question 2  
# Issue: 'Student_name' had a capitalized 'S', which violates case sensitivity since it was declared as 'student_name'.
student_name = "Aman"
print("Student Name:", student_name)

#   Question 3  
# Issue: Variable names cannot contain spaces ('student name'). Replaced with an underscore.
student_name = "Rahul"
print("Student Name:", student_name)

#   Question 4  
# Issue: Variable names cannot begin with a number ('1student_name').
student_name = "Ravi"
print("Student Name:", student_name)

#   Question 5  
# Issue: Variable names cannot contain hyphens ('student-name') as '-' is the subtraction operator.
student_name = "Rohan"
print("Student Name:", student_name)

#   Question 6  
# Issue: No issue; valid variable assignments and print statements.
student_name = "Neha"
student_age = 19
print("Name:", student_name)
print("Age:", student_age)

#   Question 7  
# Issue: No issue; Python is case-sensitive, so 'Student_Name' and 'student_name' are two distinct valid variables.
Student_Name = "Karan"
student_name = "Raj"
print("Student 1:", Student_Name)
print("Student 2:", student_name)

#   Question 8  
# Issue: 'student age' contained a space and in print 'student_age' was called. Replaced space with underscore.
student_name = "Priya"
student_age = 19
print("Name:", student_name)
print("Age:", student_age)

#   Question 9  
# Issue: Variable name '2name' started with a digit. Renamed to 'name_2'.
name_2 = "Amit"
student_age = 18
print("Name:", name_2)
print("Age:", student_age)

#   Question 10  
# Issue: 'studentName' in print() did not match the declared variable 'student_name'.
college_name = "ABC College"
student_name = "Meera"
print("College:", college_name)
print("Student:", student_name)

#   Question 11  
# Issue: No issue; variables properly initialized and printed.
first_name = "Raj"
last_name = "Patel"
print("Full Name:", first_name, last_name)

#   Question 12  
# Issue: 'first name' contained a space in variable assignment.

last_name = "Patel"
print("Full Name:", first_name, last_name)
